- Write clear, specific instructions: Be explicit and unambiguous when writing your instructions in .assistant_workspace_instructions.md always in Brazilian Portuguese.
- Keep instructions under 20,000 characters: Instruction files are limited to 20,000 characters. Any instructions past this limit will not be used by the Assistant. Be concise and prioritize important instructions.
- Use headings and delimiters for structure: Instructions are in Markdown files. Use Markdown formatting in your instructions to provide structure. Use bullet points as delimiters to separate out distinct instructions. Use headings to group together a set of instructions. For example, you might have a heading for "Python code conventions" that includes a bulleted list of Python-specific guidelines that the Assistant should follow when working with Python code.
- Scope: The Assistant applies instructions to every response it generates when you interact with it using Inline Assistant, General Chat, Suggest Fix, Edit mode, etc. However, the Assistant does not consider instructions for Quick Fix and Autocomplete. Keep instructions broadly relevant to different Assistant functions to avoid unintended behavior.
- Do not add code snippets in instructions
- Provide context and references: While the Assistant uses surrounding context like notebook code and table metadata, it does not yet proactively fetch additional information based on the instructions. To ensure helpful responses, include any key details directly in the instructions, such as when to use a particular table or function.
- Use the Lessons Learned in .trae/skills/workspace-assistant-instructions/SKILL.md
- After creating or updating a instruction, review all instruction and reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. Document these insights by editing the .trae/skills/workspace-assistant-instructions/SKILL.md file and adding them to the Lessons Learned section. This continuous improvement process helps refine skill development practices over time.
